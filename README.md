# Nugo

*A cross platform NuGet package server written in Go*

Nugo aims to be a self contained, NuGet/Chocolatey compatible package server
which could act as a drop-in replacement for the ASP.Net NuGet server.

Why?

* Run on any platform supported by Go (Windows, OS X, Linux, etc.)
* Self contained - no dependency on .Net, IIS, Apache, etc.
